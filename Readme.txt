ASTrio In-house-built Base Engine (AIBE) is a base-project aimed to help to quickly build an application which deal with a lot of typical operations (or actions) on database tables (such warehouse projects) with customization capability. 

*) Such projects normally require the code writing for all the controls, actions, and user rights needed for each of the table operations (such as Index, Create, Edit, Delete, and Details). 
*) With AIBE, only minimal scripts are required to configure them - greatly increase the development speed. Its code is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for additional customized controls, actions (for instance, to make a report from a table row or to export the table to Excel), or user rights to be easily added. 
*) The script creation could also be further eased by making use of "AIBE Editor" (https://github.com/ian5666987/AIBE_Editor)- the editor I create specifically to write AIBE scripts with minimal effort.
*) This project is NOT to be used alone (therefore it is a BASE project), but together with a GUI project built on top of the AIBE engine. 
*) Please find my AIDE (ASTrio In-house-built Desktop Engine) project (https://github.com/ian5666987/AIDE) for an example of such GUI project for desktop application. 
*) Please change the "DHObscured" class name to "DH" to be able to compile the project.
*) AIBE engine is created solely by me while working at ASTrio Tech.
*) There is another project called AIWE (ASTrio In-house-built Web Engine) which is also a GUI project (for web application) built on top of AIBE solely built by me. But the git repository for that project is private since it is used by ASTrio Tech to build projects for their customers and cannot be shared with others.
